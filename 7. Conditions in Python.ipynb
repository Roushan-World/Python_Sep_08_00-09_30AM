    " * __Decision making is required when we want to execute a code only if a certain condition is satisfied.__\n",
    " * __The if/elif/else statement is used in Python for decision making.__\n",
    " * __An else statement can be combined with an if statement.__\n",
    " * __An else statement contains the block of code that executes if the conditional expression in the if statement resolves to 0 or a False value.__\n",
    " * __The else statement is an optional statement and there could be at most only one else statement following if.__\n",
    " * __The elif statement allows you to check multiple expressions for True and execute a block of code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to True.__\n",
    " * __Similar to the else, the elif statement is optional.__\n",
    " * __However, unlike else, for which there can be at most one statement, there can be an arbitrary number of elif statements following an if.__\n",
